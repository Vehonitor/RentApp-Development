Rent Management App.

Rent Management App, is a cloud based application that helps in making home and commercial rental a hassle-free process. App will be primarily focused on traditional home / apartment rental process followed in India but will also have capability to support rental management for individuals or commercial purpose in any location. Unlike in US or most of the western countries, most rental spaces in India are offered by common individual people who currently do not use apps to manage renting. With no open and standard communication steps renting had become a complex process between owner and tenant. If the owner and tenant do not live in the same location, this communication becomes much more complex.  Introducing an app where both owner and tenant can interact and communicate will make the renting process much more simpler and will strengthen the owner â€“ tenant relationship.
This app will also help streamline commercial asset owners to track their asset utility, cost vs income and track maintence requests.
